## About me

Self-taught web developer with over seven years of experience in developing websites and marketing promotion of web products for small and medium-sized businesses in Russia.

I manage web development projects:

- supervising the quality and terms of development.
- delegating html-layout job
- selecting new performers for the project and manage the development schedule

I'm taking a free course from the community [The Rolling Scopes](http://rollingscopes.com/) in order to validate myself and test the accumulated knowledge over many years of practical development
